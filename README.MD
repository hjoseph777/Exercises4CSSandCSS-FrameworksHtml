Ensure the items are spaced out evenly across the section.
Give each flex item its own padding and background colour to differentiate them.

Use CSS Grid to display the six portfolio items in a 2x3 grid (2 columns and 3 rows).
Add some gaps between the grid items for better spacing.
Style the grid items with background colours and padding.
